**About Andrew** Andrew recieved his Eagle Scout award about twelve seconds before his 18th birthday from Troop 21 in Bend, Oregon. Some years later, he rediscovered a forgotten love for Scouting which the goings on of life had gradually crowded out. Now he works as a volunteer leader, and seeks to share the richness and value of Scouting with you. Professionally, Andrew is a software designer and illustrator. He lives with his family in Austin, Texas.
